Description

Secure multi-party computation is a fundamental problem in cryptography.
In this problem we have a set of parties who distrust one another, yet
wish to work together to compute a function over inputs they do not wish
to share with one another.

Over the last 5 years interest in the problem has increased as advances in
areas of Cryptography have shown that general purpose Secure MPC is practical.
My project will focus on Two Party Secure computation, and in particular the
Yao Garbled Circuit approach to the problem.

The final goal of my project is to provide an implementation of Lindell's
paper "Fast Cut-and-Choose Based Protocols for Malicious and Covert Adversaries"
(eprints/2013/079). A stretch goal is to implement other protocols and variants
upon these protocols for the purpose of performance comparisons.
