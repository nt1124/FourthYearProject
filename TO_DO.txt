TO_DO

	- 	Function to get majority output from an array of evaluated Circuits.
	-	Rename circuit folder to something that clearly indicates purpose.
	-	Function to grow circuits from a common skeleton to reduce File I/O.
	-	Parallelise the OT computations (Massive performance gains to be made here).
	-	Function to commit a Circuit array's keys.
