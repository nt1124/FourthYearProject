		\frametitle{Presentation overview}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item My project focuses on Secure Multiparty Computation, in particular the two party case using Yao Garbled Circuits.
			\item The final aim is to implement the as yet unimplemented protocol laid out by Lindell in ``Fast Cut-and-Choose based Protocol for Malicious and Covert Adversaries'' (henceforth Lindell 2014).

			\item By the end of this presentation you should know,
			\begin{itemize}
				\item What is Secure Multiparty Computation?
				\item What can it be used for?
				\item The basics of Yao Garbled Circuits.
				\item What progress have we made so far.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{What is Secure Multiparty Computation?}
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In the problem of Secure Multiparty Computation we have a set of parties, each of whom has a secret input.
			\item The parties wish to co-operate to compute a function upon their collective inputs without revealing said inputs to one another.
			\item Some example applications are,
			\begin{itemize}
				\item The Millionaires problem.
				\item Distributed secrets.
				\item Sugar Beets (Auctions).
				\item Database query.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}



	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Desired security properties}

		Before we go any further we need to define what properties we want an SMC protocol to fulfill before we consider it Secure.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Privacy}, the only knowledge parties gain from participating is their proper outputs.
			\item \textbf{Correctness}, the output is indeed that of the intended function.
			\item \textbf{Independence of inputs}, no party can choose it's inputs as the function of other parties inputs.
			%\item \textbf{Fairness}, corrupt parties receive their outputs if and only if the honest parties also receive their outputs.
		\end{itemize}

		% Privacy - Note this is very dependent on the function. For example if the function is simple addition then clearly an adversary can calculate the other parties input as the output minus its own input. But the only information they gain is their intended output.
		% Correctness - Note this does not mean we can force proper inputs from other parties. Only that the function will act correctly on their input.
		% Indie. Inputs - Think of an auction situation, if I can make my input be the other party's input + 1 things fall apart.
		% Fairness - Avoid corrupt parties getting their output (e.g. a Signature) unless the Honest party gets what they came here for.

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Security Definitions}
		
		\begin{itemize}

		\item We measure the security of an SMC protocol in terms of what adversaries it is secure against.
		
		\item We define adversaries in terms of their capabilities.

		\item We say that an SMC protocl is secure against an adversary if the adversary can achieve no more than they would be able to achieve attacking the Ideal Model.

		\item We focus on three adversaries,
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Semi-Honest 
			\item Malicious 
			\item Covert
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
		% Acknowledge we're skipping over Static and Active corruption issues.

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Semi-Honest Adversaries}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Semi-Honest(SH) adversaries are the weakest adversary we shall consider.
			\item They are sometimes also called ``honest, but curious''.
			\item SH adversaries are limited to looking at information given to them in the process of the protocol.
			\item They have to follow the protocol (they cannot cheat). 
			\item SH adversaries are very similar to traditional ``Passive'' adversaries.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}


	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Malicious and Coverts Adversaries}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Malicious adversaries are the strongest adversary.
			\item Malicious adversaries can use any arbitrary strategy. We do not assume that they follow the protocol.
			\bigskip
			\item Covert Adversaries are slightly weaker than Malicious Adversaries.
			\item Covert Adversaries can also use any arbitrary strategy, but they are adverse to being caught.
			\item They are willing to accept a certain probability of getting caught.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Oblivious Transfer}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A key component we will need later is Oblivious transfer(OT).
			\item Security definitions for OTs is are very similar to SMC, though we don't really look at the Covert case.

				\item \textbf{Sender:} Encrypt $X_0$ using $PK_0$ as $C_0$ and encrypt $X_1$ using $PK_1$ as $C_1$. Send $C_0$ and $C_1$ to the Receiver.\\
				\item \textbf{Receiver:} Receives $C_0$ and $C_1$, then decrypt $C_b$ using $D$. Output this decrypted value.

		\frametitle{Yao Garbled Circuits}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item First we need some notation for binary circuits.
			\item We denote the value of wire  $w_i$ as $b_i$, we generate two random ``garble value'', denote these by $k_i^0$ and $k_i^1$.
			\item We then generate a random permutation for each wire $w_i$, denote this by $\pi_i$.
			\item For each gate we create an encryption table indexed by $c_i$ and $c_j$ (where the input wires to the gate are $w_i$ and $w_j$).

		\begin{itemize}
			\item We extend this to all gates of the circuit.
			\item The Builder then sends the circuit to the Executor, stripped of the values of the permutations and keys.
			% Note this means we're hardcoding the builders keys
			\item The Builder then sends the keys relating to the values for its input wires.
			\item The Builder also sends the permutations for the Executors input wires and the Executors output wires.
			\item The Executor then obtains the keys for its inputs by running Oblivious transfers with the Builder.
			\item Finally the Executor uses the keys evaluate the circuit.

		\frametitle{Yao Garble Circuits - Malicious Security}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Naively implemented Yao Garbled Circuits are only Semi-Honest secure.
			\item Can anyone suggest why this might be?
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Yao Garble Circuits - Malicious Security}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Yao Garbled Circuits are only secure up to Semi-Honest adversaries because we are trusting that the Circuit builder is building the correct circuit.
			\item There are several ways to extend Yao Garbled Circuits to achieve security in the presence of Malicious adversaries.
			\item In particular I'm looking at ``Cut-and-choose'', a method loosely inspired by the solution to dividing a cake evenly between two parties.
			\item One person cuts the cake into two halves, the other person chooses which half they want.
		\end{itemize}

	\end{frame}

	
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Cut-and-Choose}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item In Cut-and-choose the builder generates many circuits.
			\item The Executor then picks a random subset of the circuits and ``opens'' them, to check that they give the correct result.
			\item If any of the ``Check-Circuits'' fail the Executor knows the Builder is trying to cheat.
			\item The Executor then evaluates all the remaining un-opened circuits and returns the majority output.
			\item The number of circuits the builder creates is a security parameter and defines how likely a cheating adversary is to remain undetected.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	
	\begin{frame}
		\frametitle{Cut-and-Choose - Not so simple}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Cut-and-choose seems like an incredibly simple solution to solve all our problems, but it creates several new problems.
			\item For example we need to ensure the Builder gives the same input for every circuit, without knowing what their input should be!
			\item The Executor also has to careful about how they react to detecting cheating, they can't just immediately abort.
